# SkillsForgeGameDevProject_CatchGame
 This is a catch game made for my SkillsForge task
 The game has a cyber undertone and is based on a charcter set to collect as many skill points (the blue fire balls) while avoiding the viruses (the green slime monsters). You have five lives... how many skill points can you collect?

 ##How to play
 1. Move the character using the left and right arrow keys.
 2. Score points by catching the safe sprites.
 3. Lose points if you catch the dangerous sprites.
 4. Game over when you run out of lives.

##Unity Version Used.
Unity (2022.3.50f1).
Run on Windows.
